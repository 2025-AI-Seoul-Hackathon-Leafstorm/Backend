# Triggered via API request.
# Reads a processed document JSON file from S3, sends it to Upstage's solar-pro model for summarization,
# stores the Markdown result back to S3, and returns the summary in the response.

# Required external library:
openai==1.52.2

# Note:
# AWS Lambda currently uses Python 3.13 as of this writing.
# If you encounter compatibility errors, ensure the architecture and Python runtime of your Lambda environment
# match your local environment where dependencies were packaged.

# To verify compatibility, run this command and confirm it outputs .so files targeting Python 3.13:
# Example:
# $ find python -name "*.so"
# python/jiter/jiter.cpython-313-x86_64-linux-gnu.so
# python/pydantic_core/_pydantic_core.cpython-313-x86_64-linux-gnu.so
